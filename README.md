**Project is still in very early stages and documentation is incomplete/nonexistent in most parts, here will be a way to get started if you want to contribute.**

Download that archive from the URL above, extract it somewhere, run `freenitori` once, and edit the configuration file, fill in the credentials and change the path to database, then run the program again.

When using the Makefile, remember to run `make` at least once then use `make run` in development (which remove an extra downloading stage and automatically starts the program).
